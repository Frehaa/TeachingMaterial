1. Introduction?????
2. Motivate the problem:
  The problem is to take some things and group them (union them) and afterwards be able to check if two things are in the same group
--3. We have some animals, rocks, video games, movies, etc. which can be grouped together.--
3. 4. 
5. 
6. An array to represent the opjects we want to union as its positions and the groups as the values in the array


Go over union-find with the three simple implementations to motivate the use of efficient algorithms to solve a problem. 

People and relationships is better since we can then motivate with the reason to connect people from the same "friend
group" or from different groups, or see when everybody is connected, etc. It seems to be a better motivating example
since the "liveness" is clearer, but it would be nice to have something more interesting than names or stickmen... 

Introduce array as the datastructure to keep track of everything. 

Show how we can solve the problem by making every
