How does the abstract algorithm work:
  1. random element
  2. Split
  3. Recurse on both sides

We end up with a tree structure which if we traverse in in-order we get the sorted elements. 

Motivate why it has to be a random element!

Go into detail with why it works with an actual implementation (maybe choose a very simple implementation) 

Go into detail with why it is expected to be efficient (Advanced Algorithms stuff).
